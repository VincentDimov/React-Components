# Practice Exercise #6 â€“ React Components

Create three components: **Header**, **Main**, and **Footer**

## Header

Return a `<header>` tag that contains an `<h1>` and an `<h2>`.

Create variables for your **name**, **class**, and the **name of your program**.  
Display the name of your program inside the `<h1>`, and your name + class inside the `<h2>`.

With CSS:
- Set the height to **200px**
- Set the background color to **light blue**

---

## Main

Return a `<main>` tag and inside it, create a **Top 5 list** for any topic  
(for example: my top 5 favorite fruits, movies, travel destinations, etc.).

It should be a **numbered list**, so use `<li>` tags.

### Extra:
- Create an **array** with your top 5 list items and display them using a **loop**.

### Extra 2:
- Create a **component** for your top 5 list that takes an array as **props** and then loops through it.

With CSS:
- Set the height to **200px**
- Set the background color to **light green**

---

## Aside

Return an `<aside>` tag that contains **links to external websites** related to your top 5 list.  
(For example, if your top 5 list is about favorite movies, you can link to their IMDb pages such as:  
`https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/`)

---

## Footer

Return a `<footer>` tag that contains the following text:

@Copyright. All rights reserved by Batman.


The text should be stored in a **variable**.

With CSS:
- Set the text color to **white**
- Set the background color to **black**
- Set the height to **100px**

---

## App.js

Render all components in the correct order inside **App.js**.
