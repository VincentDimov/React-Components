Practice Exercise â€“ React Components

Create three components: Header, Main, and Footer

Header:

Return a <header> tag that contains an <h1> and an <h2>.
Create variables for your name, class, and the name of your program.
Display the name of your program inside the <h1>, and your name + class inside the <h2>.

Using CSS, give your header:

a height of 200px

a light blue background color.

Main:

Return a <main> tag and inside it, create a Top 5 list for any topic
(for example: my top 5 favorite fruits, movies, travel destinations, etc.).
It should be a numbered list, so use <li> tags.

Extra:

Create an array with your top 5 list items and display them using a loop.
Extra 2:

Create a component for your top 5 list that takes an array as props and then loops through it.

Using CSS, give your div:

a height of 200px

a light green background color.

Aside:

Return an <aside> tag that contains links to external websites related to your top 5 list.
(For example, if your top 5 list is about favorite movies, you can link to their IMDb pages such as:
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/)

Footer:

Return a <footer> tag that contains the following text:
@Copyright. All rights reserved by Batman.

The text should be stored in a variable.

Using CSS, give the footer:

white text color

black background color

100px height

Finally, render all components in the correct order inside App.js.
